    3. If you wish to process only one common offset, converge the ends of the interval at one point.
3. Select the options if you wish. (By default, signals will be normalized by the maximum value of the seismic shot.
4. Warning! Warning! With each processing performed, data with the same common offset will be overwritten by the new ones.
